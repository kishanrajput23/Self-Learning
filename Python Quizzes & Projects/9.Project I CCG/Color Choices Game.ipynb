If these notes below isn,t fully helpful for you , check out the \"Project Walkthrough\" for more explanation and help. \n\n# <a id='Asking_Questions'></a>\n# ## Asking Questions:\n# ### Before looking at the Colors Choices Game Project, you should start by asking questions you might want to understand  the Colors Choices Game(CCG) \n# ### Consider, for example, if you were working for Motivate. What kinds of game is CCG?\n# ### order to create and build this project you need to know what is the type of CCG game? \n# ### If you were a user CCG , Do you know what the level of difficulty this game has? \n# ### Do you enjoy playing those types of games?\n# \n# **Question**: \n# \n# **Answer**:\n\n# <a id='Project_Helpful_Notes'></a>\n# ## Project Helpful Notes:\n# ### 1.We need to create choices for players and choices for computer then ask the players for inputs.\n# ### 2.compare their inputs with the choice of the computer.\n# ### 3.Check if the game is won,tied, lost, or ongoing.\n# ### 4.Repeat thess steps until the game has been won or tied.\n# ### 5.Ask if players want to play again.\n# ### 6.and if the players agree restart the game again.\n# ### 7.and if the player say \"No\" end the game and say thanks for the player.\n\n# <a id='Project_Helpful_Steps'></a>\n# ## Project Helpful Steps:\n# ### 1.importing needed modules for our project.\n# ### 2.Then we will define the main while loop and put the second while loop inside it.\n# ### 3.declare colors choices as variables and specify colors of the game inside the nested while loop.\n# ### 4.define the game roles by using the second while loop, If Statements and the random moduleâ€™s randint function to get an integer between one and five.\n# ### 5.then print the outputs of this big nested loop and hte If statements inside this big while loop.\n# ### 6.show the scores of computer and player after each player turn.\n# ### 7.use the If statements to ask the player if he want to play again.\n# ### 8.if the player choose \"Yes\" so restart the game.\n# ### 9.if the player say \"No\" so end the game and say \"thanks for playing\".\n\n","metadata":{},"id":"edea657c-42f7-4eec-a893-bd5540465980"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# import random module \nimport random ","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[],"id":"35700a32-5f29-4193-b3d7-b8ab2d4d241a"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <a id='Show_colors_choices_to_user_to_choose_&_enter_a_color'></a>\n# ## Declare computer_score and player_score as variables\n# ## Show colors choices to user to choose & enter a color value number:","metadata":{},"id":"acc3b283-946b-43b6-ab57-cd372341708e"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Print multiline instruction \n# performstring concatenation of string \nprint(\"Winning Rules of the Colors choices Game as follows: \"+ \"\\nEnter a number from one two five and match computer choice to Win the computer.\") \ncomputer_score = 0\nplayer_score = 0 \n\nwhile True: \n    print(\"red = 1 \\nyellow = 2 \\norange = 3 \\ngreen = 4 \\nblue = 5 \\ntake a turn: \") \n \n    # take the input from user \n    player_choice = int(input(\"User turn: \")) \n  \n    # OR is the short-circuit operator \n    # if any one of the condition is true \n    # then it return True value \n      \n    # looping until user enter invalid input \n    while player_choice > 5 and player_choice < 1: \n        player_choice = int(input(\"enter valid input: \"))\n          \n  \n    # initialize value of choice_col variable \n    # corresponding to the player_choice value \n    if player_choice == 1: \n        choice_col = 'red'\n    elif player_choice == 2: \n        choice_col = 'yellow'\n    elif player_choice == 3: \n        choice_col= 'orange'\n    elif player_choice== 4: \n        choice_col = 'green'    \n    else: \n        choice_col = 'blue'\n          \n    # print user choice  \n    print(\"user color choice is: \" + choice_col) \n    print(\"\\nNow its computer turn to choose a color.......\") \n  \n    # Computer chooses randomly any number  \n    # among 1 , 2 and 3.
