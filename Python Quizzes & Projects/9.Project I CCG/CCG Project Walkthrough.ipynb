What kinds of game is CCG?\n# ### order to create and build this project you need to know what is the type of CCG game? \n# ### If you were a user CCG , Do you know what the level of difficulty this game has? \n# ### Do you enjoy playing those types of games?\n# \n# **Question**: \n# \n# **Answer**:\n\n# <a id='Project_Helpful_Notes'></a>\n# ## Project Helpful Notes:\n# ### 1.We need to create choices for players and choices for computer then ask the players for inputs.\n# ### 2.compare their inputs with the choice of the computer.\n# ### 3.Check if the game is won,tied, lost, or ongoing.\n# ### 4.Repeat thess steps until the game has been won or tied.\n# ### 5.Ask if players want to play again.\n# ### 6.and if the players agree restart the game again.\n# ### 7.and if the player say \"No\" end the game and say thanks for the player.\n\n# <a id='Project_Helpful_Steps'></a>\n# ## Project Helpful Steps:\n# ### 1.importing needed modules for our project.\n# ### 2.Then we will define the main while loop and put the second while loop inside it.\n# ### 3.declare colors choices as variables and specify colors of the game inside the nested while loop.\n# ### 4.define the game roles by using the second while loop, If Statements and the random moduleâ€™s randint function to get an integer between one and five.\n# ### 5.then print the outputs of this big nested loop and hte If statements inside this big while loop.\n# ### 6.show the scores of computer and player after each player turn.\n# ### 7.use the If statements to ask the player if he want to play again.\n# ### 8.if the player choose \"Yes\" so restart the game.\n# ### 9.if the player say \"No\" so end the game and say \"thanks for playing\".\n# \n\n# ## importing needed modules for our project:\n\n# In[6]:\n\n\n# import random module \nimport random \n\n\n# <a id='Show_colors_choices_to_user_to_choose_&_enter_a_color'></a>\n# ## Declare computer_score and player_score as variables\n# ## Show colors choices to user to choose & enter a color value number:\n\n# In[8]:\n\n\n# Print multiline instruction \n# performstring concatenation of string \n ","metadata":{},"id":"3251a407-2196-4156-b096-9bf9e959e001"}]}
