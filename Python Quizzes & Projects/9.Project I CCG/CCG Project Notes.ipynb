Taking in a player input:\n### how to take in a players input, you have to use input() You can use it as following:\n### player_choice = int(input(\"enter valid input: \")) you should make it int(input()) to avoid coding errors.\n### Then you would see a pop-up message occur with a text box asking you for your input.\n### then you will Type in the number and press enter.\n### Now the program will compare between computer choice and the player input.\n# 2. Ensure of a player valid input:\n### in the project solution,the program remind a player to put in a correct and a valid input again from number one to number five (1,2,3,4,5) through a message in the start of the game .","metadata":{},"id":"c431d9f5-ae6f-4d24-9ed8-4452cafe0dd6"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"b9631199-974f-412e-bb7b-d0413888b2b4"}]}
