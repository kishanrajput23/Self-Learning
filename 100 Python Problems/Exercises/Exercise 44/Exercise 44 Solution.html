<p><strong><u>Exercise for reference</u>: </strong></p>











<p>Create a script that generates a file where all letters of English alphabet are listed three in each line.</p>















<p><u><strong>Answer:</strong></u><strong> </strong></p>















<pre class="prettyprint linenums">import string

letters = string.ascii_lowercase + " "

slice1 = letters[0::3]
slice2 = letters[1::3]
slice3 = letters[2::3]

with open("letters.txt", "w") as file:
    for s1, s2, s3 in zip(slice1, slice2, slice3):
        file.write(s1 + s2 + s3 + "\n")
</pre>





























<p><strong><u>Explanation</u></strong>:</p>















<p>This is like the previous exercise with the difference that we're using a different slicing step of 3 here. Another difference is that we are adding one white spaces to <code>ascii_lowercase </code> so that we get a string of 27 items as opposed to 26 that <code>ascii_lowercase </code> provides. By slicing<code>ascii_lowercase</code> we would get two slices with a length of 9 and one slice with a length of 8. </p>



<p>That means the iteration would stop at the shortest slice so letters y and z wouldn't be written in the file. That's why we add a white space so we get three slices each with a length of 9. That means we get 9 iterations and not 8 as we would get with the original <code>ascii_lowercase </code> string. The 9th iteration would write letters y and z in the file.</p>









<p>Note that this solution might not be the best and there are surely improvements to be made so the script works with any number of letters.</p>
