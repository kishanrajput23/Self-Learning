<p><strong><u>Exercise for reference</u>: </strong><br></p>



<p>Create a program that asks the user to enter a new password and check that the submitted password should contain at least one number, one uppercase letter and at least 5 characters. If the conditions are met, print out the reason why pointing to the specific condition/s that has not been satisfied.</p>

















<p><u><strong>Answer:</strong><strong> </strong></u></p>

















<pre class="prettyprint linenums">while True:
    notes = []
    psw = input("Enter password: ")
    if not any(i.isdigit() for i in psw):
        notes.append("You need at least one number")
    if not any(i.isupper() for i in psw):
        notes.append("You need at least one uppercase letter")
    if len(psw) &lt; 5:
        notes.append("You need at least 5 characters")
    if len(notes) == 0:
        print("Password is fine")
        break
    else:
        print("Please check the following: ")
        for note in notes:
            print(note)
</pre>

































<p><strong><u>Explanation</u></strong>:</p>

















<p>Again, we're using a <code>while</code> loop. In the first <code>if</code>  condition we check if there is any number in the submitted password and if there is we append a message string to the <code>notes</code>  list. Then, we check the next conditions in the next two <code>if</code>  conditionals and keep adding messages to <code>notes</code> . We also check if the length of <code>notes</code>  is zero, because it if is that means there were no message added there which means the password is fine. Lastly, under <code>else</code> , we iterate through the constructed list and print out its items (i.e messages).</p>
