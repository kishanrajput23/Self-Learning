<p><strong><u>Exercise for reference</u>:&nbsp;</strong></p>







<p>Create a script that asks the user to enter their age and the script calculates the user's year of birth and prints it out in a string like in the expected output. Please make sure you generate the current year dynamically.</p>









<p><u><strong>Answer:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></u></p>









<pre class="prettyprint linenums">from datetime import datetime

age = int(input("What's your age? "))
year_birth = datetime.now().year - age
print("We think you were born back in %s" % year_birth)
</pre>

















<p><strong><u>Explanation</u></strong>:</p>









<p>We're getting user input and we are converting&nbsp;it to an integer since <code>input </code>&nbsp;loads everything as a string. Then we produce the current year dynamically with <code>datetime.now().year</code>&nbsp; and we subtract the age from that to find out the year of birth. Lastly, in line 5, we use string formatting to produce a string with the year inside it.</p>
