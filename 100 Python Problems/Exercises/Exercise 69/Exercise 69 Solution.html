<p><strong><u>Exercise for reference</u>: </strong></p>



<p>Please create an empty file (manually as you normally create Python files) and name it <code>requests.py</code> . Make sure the file has that name exactly.
</p>

<p>Then just paste the following code in the file (manually)</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">import requests

r = requests.get("http://www.pythonhow.com")
print(r.text[:100])
</pre>





















<p>Executing the script will throw an error. Please fix that error so that you get the expected output and explain why the error happened.</p>









<p><u><strong>Answer:</strong><strong> </strong></u></p>









<p>Rename the file name from <code>requests.py</code>  to something else.</p>











<p><strong><u>Explanation</u></strong>:</p>











<p>In the code Python is actually referring to the script name which is <code>requests </code> and it doesn't find a get attribute for that name. Script names load in the current namespace. They are actually stored in the<code> __name__</code>  variable. You could try to print that variable out and you would see that it prints your script name. Therefore you should not name your scripts under library names. </p>
