Hi, this is the solution to exercise 84

1
00:03.360 --> 00:05.880
and this was the output.

2
00:05.950 --> 00:15.700
So let me close that. And this is the code and let me show how I came up with this code because to be honest I'm

3
00:15.720 --> 00:23.310
not very familiar with the pyglet library but if you follow the standard procedure of researching about a library

4
00:23.310 --> 00:26.370
you should be able to come up with some sample code.

5
00:26.370 --> 00:29.660
So let me show you how would you do that.

6
00:30.300 --> 00:31.950
A simple search for pyglet

7
00:35.760 --> 00:43.240
should show you the pyglet the home page but also the pyglet home page in the Python Package Index website.

8
00:43.260 --> 00:45.440
I prefer this. This is more standard.

9
00:45.750 --> 00:53.910
So you have, here you have all the packages for Python listed in this website and they all have their

10
00:54.520 --> 00:55.920
home pages in there.

11
00:55.940 --> 01:01.640
This is the home page of pyglet. Sometimes you can find some sample code right here in this page.

12
01:01.650 --> 01:07.380
But if you don't find it, than you have to look for that documentation link such as this one in here.

13
01:10.850 --> 01:13.970
And then you have various links for the documentation.

14
01:13.990 --> 01:14.920
And the one you want

15
01:14.940 --> 01:24.770
in this case is a programming guide and this is the guide for people who are starting with pyglet.

16
01:25.410 --> 01:28.690
Pyglet is a library for games, to build games

17
01:28.690 --> 01:38.480
by the way. I mentioned earlier and yet here you'd want to go to writing a pyglet application and

18
01:38.750 --> 01:44.510
you have various applications such as the hello world application image viewer way you can show an image

19
01:45.310 --> 01:46.830
in a pyglet window.

20
01:46.970 --> 01:55.760
But this is although the one we want and this is exactly the same code that builds this program that I showed

21
01:55.770 --> 01:56.630
you.

22
01:57.360 --> 02:02.780
So this is importing pyglet and you need to install pyglet, so if you see that when you run

23
02:02.780 --> 02:08.720
the code, you get an import error. That means that you need to install pyglet with pip install pyglet.

24
02:09.230 --> 02:17.440
And then you want to create a window object with this code and after that what you want to display

25
02:17.450 --> 02:23.330
is some text. To display text it says that you create a label object like this label here.

26
02:23.350 --> 02:29.450
And here are, these are the parameters. I guess they are quite clear.

27
02:30.200 --> 02:39.020
So it's putting the text in the center of the window and then you have this decorator which is attached

28
02:39.090 --> 02:46.220
to these objects so at window events, so when an event happensr which in this case means when the window

29
02:46.220 --> 02:49.360
is opened. The windows should clear first

30
02:49.430 --> 02:54.950
if it has something, and then a label should be drawn in the window.

31
02:55.130 --> 02:59.490
And then finally you have pyglet.app.run.

32
02:59.570 --> 03:01.960
So these will run the app.

33
03:01.970 --> 03:06.240
Yeah, this is exactly the same code as mine in here.

34
03:06.260 --> 03:13.190
So the purpose I included this application was to show you how to do some research for code samples

35
03:13.610 --> 03:15.280
on a new library.

36
03:15.350 --> 03:17.640
I hope you enjoyed this, and I'll talk to you later.
