<p>The code produces an error. Please understand the error and try to fix it</p>









<pre class="prettyprint linenums">age = input("What's your age? ")
age_last_year = age - 1
print("Last year you were %s." % age_last_year)</pre>















<p><u><strong>Answer 1:</strong><strong> </strong>
</u></p>









<pre class="prettyprint linenums">age = int(input("What's your age? "))
age_last_year = age - 1
print("Last year you were %s." % age_last_year)
</pre>

















<p><strong><u>Explanation 1</u></strong>:</p>









<p>As you can see we applied an <code>int </code> function to the <code>input </code> function. That converts user input to an integer right away.</p>



<p><u><strong>Answer 2:</strong><strong> </strong></u></p>





<pre class="prettyprint linenums">age = input("What's your age? ")
age_last_year = int(age) - 1
print("Last year you were %s." % age_last_year)
</pre>









<p><strong><u>Explanation 2</u></strong>:</p>





<p>In this alternative solution we applied the <code>int </code> function in the line where the math operation is taking place. This could be useful if you're intending to use the user input value as a string in other parts of your script, so you don't want to convert it to an integer directly.</p>
