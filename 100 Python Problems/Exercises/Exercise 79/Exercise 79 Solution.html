<p><strong><u>Exercise for reference</u>:&nbsp;</strong></p>























<p>Create a program asks the user to enter a new password and check that the submitted&nbsp;password should&nbsp;contain&nbsp;at least one number, one uppercase letter and at least 5 characters. If the conditions are generated, print out "Password is fine", otherwise keep prompting the user&nbsp;for a password.</p>

























<p><u><strong>Answer:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></u>
</p>

























<pre class="prettyprint linenums">while True:
    psw = input("Enter new password: ")
    if any(i.isdigit() for i in psw) and any(i.isupper() for i in psw) and len(psw) &gt;= 5:
        print("Password is fine")
        break
    else:
        print("Password is not fine")
</pre>

















































<p><strong><u>Explanation</u></strong>:</p>

























<p>We're using a <code>while </code>&nbsp;loop here because we need to keep the program running until the user submits a password that satisfies all three conditions. Line 3 contains the three conditions connected with an <code>and </code>&nbsp;operator. Line 3 becomes <code>True </code>&nbsp;only when all three conditions are <code>True</code>&nbsp;. If that happens, <code>Password is fine</code>&nbsp; is generated, and the&nbsp;<code>break </code>&nbsp;statement&nbsp;will break the loop, and the program will stop. If at least one of the conditions in Line 3&nbsp;is <code>False</code>&nbsp;, Line 3 evaluates to <code>False </code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;the <code>print </code>&nbsp;statement under else is executed and the loop starts over again.</p>
