"""
Write a function that accepts 2 strings (first_name, last_name). 
The function should concatenate these two strings by inserting a space in between the strings and then reverse the resultant string.

Example:

first_name = 'Allen'

last_name  = 'Brown'

Expected output = 'nworB nellA'
"""

def string_reverse(first_name,last_name):
    new_string = last_name[::-1] + " " +first_name[::-1] 
    return new_string
